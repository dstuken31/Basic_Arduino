NewPing- Servo moves until distance reaches a certain point

HelloFunction

For this assignment the goal was to get a servo to move using a function. The Functions used were called getDistance and microsecondsToCentimeters. getDistance is the ultrasonic sensor figuring out how far away an object is. 
microsecondsToCentimeters converst the time it takes for the wave to come back to the sensor (in microseconds) into a distance (in centimeters).
